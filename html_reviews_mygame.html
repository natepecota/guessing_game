            <li><q>I've been playing this game since it's creation 4 days ago and I'm still guessing in my first game. I refuse to cop-out and use a calculator. What do I care, I've got the time...not because I'm a vampire...because I'm not...just currently unemloyed, that's all. Endless, mild entertainment.</q>Rating: 88/100</li>

            <li><q>Maybe in, How Many Hours Have You Been Alive: The Guessing Game Part Duex, it will keep track of my guesses? So I can narrow down my guesses to find the answer? Without the help of Texas Instruments? Maybe??</q>Rating: 70/100</li>

            <li><q>Listen @thenewertheversionthebetter, I'm sick and tired of people like you ruining the integrity of ground breaking, indie games. You have no right to criticize the game. 20 years from now, when people are still guessing within their first game played, you will see how wrong you are. Down with Part Deux!!!!</q>Rating: 98/100</li>
