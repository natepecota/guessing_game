    <h1><strong>How Many Hours Have You Been Alive?: The Guessing Game</strong></h1>
    <h2>Have you ever wondered how many hours you have been alive? Ever wanted to guess and see if you were right?</h2>
    <p>If so, then this game is the answer for you! Whether you are 5 or 500 (vampires/lycans/immortals of all kinds), this game provides a sort of, mildy entertaining way to guess and see.</p>
    <h2>How to play</h2>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Step 1</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Enter your age when promted.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Step 2</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Enter your guess of how many hours you think you have been alive, no need for those pesky commas! Hint: It's more than you may think!</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Step 3 (3 Parts)</li>
          <ul>
            <li>(Part 1) If you're guess is right on the money:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>You've won the game and probably have a calcultor in your hand or have a super computer-esque brain.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>(Part 2) If you guess too high:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>You will be notified your guess is too high and will graciously have the opportunity to try again.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>(Part 3) If you guess too low:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>You will be notified your guess is too low and again, graciously be allowed to guess again.</li>
              </ul>
          </ul>
        <li>Step 4...not an actual step but something important to note!</li>
          <ul>
            <li>You have an infinite number of guesses, no aid is coming. So unless you have the aformentioned super computer-esque brain or are in fact an immortal with the free time to guess until correct, I reccomend using a good old fashioned calulator, I prefer Texas Instruments, to figure out the correct answer.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
